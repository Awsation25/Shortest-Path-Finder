This project is a C implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path between cities.
It reads city connections and costs from a text file (cities.txt) and provides options to:
Load the graph from file and display it as an adjacency matrix
Compute shortest paths from a chosen source city
Show the full route (with intermediate costs and total cost)
Save the shortest path details to shortest_path.txt
